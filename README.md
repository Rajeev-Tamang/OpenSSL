## 1. What is SSL? What is TLS ?
- The internet is many routers owned by many Diffrent ISPs. On either end : you and who you are 
   speaking too.
- When we  send request to websites, it either uses http or https, when using the http, the requested data is moved from different router and the data that travels are not encrypted, *in websites its not always asking for html file but some time we need to send the username,password,credit card number, bank account and so on and if these data are not encrypeted than our personal data are in big risk.*
- **So to solve this SSL/TLS are used.**
- SSL/TLS create a secure,protected tunnel across internet. i.e **https**
- SSL/TLS can also protect other data transfer. Example: to access corporate network(mail server, database.etc) , to connect to public vpn provider(nordvpn,experss vpn,cyberghost,etc)
